            <p>So... What is SDGs Goal 12?</p>
            <p>SDGs 12 is a Goal to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.</p>
            <div class="sdg-info">
                <p>High-income countries have an environmental footprint 10 times larger per person than low-income countries, with fossil fuel subsidies doubling from $375 billion in 2020 to $732 billion in 2021. Additionally, each person wastes an average of 120 kg of food annually.</p>
                <p>But fret not, from 2019 to 2022, 62 countries and the EU has already introduced 485 sustainable consumption policies, and company sustainability reporting has tripled since 2016.</p>

                <h2>Do you know that one of the most significant global waste is plastic?</h2>
                <p>Base on a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), approximately 300 million tons of plastic waste are generated globally each year. Out of this, only about 9% is recycled, 12% is incinerated, and the remaining 79% ends up in landfills, dumps, or the environment.</p>

                <h2>What can we do to help reduce plastic wastage?</h2>
                <p>Everyone can help create a sustainable future. Choose reusable items over single-use plastics and recycle properly. Support policies reducing plastic production and join clean-up efforts like those by The Ocean Cleanup. Advocate for innovative solutions and support sustainable brands. These actions help achieve SDG Goal 12, leading to a cleaner, healthier environment for all.</p>
